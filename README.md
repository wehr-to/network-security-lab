# 🛰️ Network Security Lab

## 🎯 Purpose
A comprehensive, protocol-aware, attack-driven network security repo covering both on-prem and cloud networking. Built for defenders, pentesters, and infrastructure engineers.

## 🧱 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Fundamentals
- OSI vs TCP/IP model
- Protocols: ARP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, DNS, HTTP
- Addressing: IPv4, IPv6, CIDR

### 🔹 Perimeter Security
- Firewalls (stateful, NGFW)
- IPS vs IDS
- VPN tunneling and split routing
- Reverse proxy and load balancer logic

### 🔹 Internal Segmentation
- VLANs and tagging
- ACLs at different layers
- Jumpboxes and chokepoints
- Zero trust enforcement

### 🔹 Protocol Attacks
- ARP spoofing
- DNS poisoning
- TCP RST injection
- Smurf and broadcast abuse

### 🔹 Detection & Monitoring
- Suricata rule design
- Zeek log analysis
- Signature vs anomaly detection
- PCAP-based traffic inspection
- NetFlow/sFlow telemetry
- eBPF-based syscall/network visibility

### 🔹 Cloud & Hybrid NetSec
- VPC and NSG logic
- NVAs and traffic inspection
- Hybrid connectivity security (VPN, DX, ExpressRoute)

### 🔹 Hardening
- Secure router/switch baselines
- DNS best practices
- NTP syncing and integrity
- Disabling unused ports and services

## ✅ To Do
- [ ] Add IPv6-specific attack simulation
- [ ] Add more eBPF security visualizations
